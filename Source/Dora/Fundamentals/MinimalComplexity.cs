Read Chapter 5 of Code Complete 2, included below as an attachment to this Wiki Page!). Avoid making ""clever"" designs. Clever designs are usually hard to understand. Instead make ""simple"" and ""easy - to - understand"" designs.  If your design doesn't let you safely ignore most other parts of the program when you’re immersed in one specific part, the design isn't doing its job";
